I enjoy reading, whether it's fiction or professional reference books. Through reading, not only do I feel relaxed, but I also gain knowledge. The knowledge acquired from books and my personal experiences collectively shape my character.Reading is not limited to physical books; it can also encompass e-books. Beyond traditional publications, it extends to online articles, blogs, and even multimedia formats. This multifaceted endeavor allows me to actively synthesize insights from diverse sources. Whether analyzing technical documentation, reflecting on thought leadership blogs, or critically evaluating news commentaries, each interaction hones my analytical thinking and expands my worldview. Ultimately, the convergence of structured knowledge from texts and dynamic perspectives from digital content continuously refines my cognitive framework.

During my freshman year, I dedicated myself to mastering algorithms and data structures through systematic study and practical application. This foundation led me to compete in prestigious programming contests like ICPC and CCPC, where my team secured multiple awards. Complementing my algorithmic training, I engineered a go-based KV storage engine, implementing a bitcask architecture. Concurrently, I contributed to rCoreOS, which is an educational operating system. These projects crystallized my methodology: applying competition-honed algorithm skills to solve systems challenges.

The convergence of these tracks aims to redefine system stacks for next-generation intelligent infrastructures. By applying OS-level resource management principles to DL acceleration, while leveraging ML techniques for autonomous system optimization, this research seeks to establish a self-evolving computing paradigm. My ultimate goal is to contribute to open-source communities through publishable system innovations while advancing industrial adoption via patentable methodologies.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would be honored to contribuwote my passion for systems research to this esteemed program.

- 为什么考电科

I believe that the best university may not be the most prestigious or renowned, but rather the one that best fits me.
