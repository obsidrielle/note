I enjoy reading, whether it's fiction or professional reference books. Through reading, not only do I feel relaxed, but I also gain knowledge. The knowledge acquired from books and my personal experiences collectively shape my character.Reading is not limited to physical books; it can also encompass e-books. Beyond traditional publications, it extends to online articles, blogs, and even multimedia formats. This multifaceted endeavor allows me to actively synthesize insights from diverse sources. Whether analyzing technical documentation, reflecting on thought leadership blogs, or critically evaluating news commentaries, each interaction hones my analytical thinking and expands my worldview. Ultimately, the convergence of structured knowledge from texts and dynamic perspectives from digital content continuously refines my cognitive framework.

During my freshman year, I dedicated myself to mastering algorithms and data structures through systematic study and practical application. This foundation led me to compete in prestigious programming contests like ICPC and CCPC, where my team secured multiple awards. Complementing my algorithmic training, I engineered a go-based KV storage engine, implementing a bitcask architecture. Concurrently, I contributed to rCoreOS, which is an educational operating system. These projects crystallized my methodology: applying competition-honed algorithm skills to solve systems challenges.

The convergence of these tracks aims to redefine system stacks for next-generation intelligent infrastructures. By applying OS-level resource management principles to DL acceleration, while leveraging ML techniques for autonomous system optimization, this research seeks to establish a self-evolving computing paradigm. My ultimate goal is to contribute to open-source communities through publishable system innovations while advancing industrial adoption via patentable methodologies.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would be honored to contribuwote my passion for systems research to this esteemed program.

- 为什么考电科
	- I believe that the best university may not necessarily be the most prestigious or renowned, but rather the one that aligns with my academic goals. The reasons why I have chosen UESTC lies in its geographical locations, academic environment and disciplinary strengths. First, UESTC is strategically located in Chengdu, a national central city recognized for its technology innovation ecosystem. Second, UESTC boasts a strong research-oriented academic environment, particularly in artificial intelligence. Finally, UESTC is nationally reowned for its computer science, which directly corrsponds to my intended field of study. Through comprehensive analysis of institutional advantages and personal aspirations, I am convinced that UESTC represents the optimal platform for me to achieve my academic and professional objectives.
	- Boast 值得突出的自豪优势


- 为什么选择考研而不是就业？
	- Why did you decide to take the graduate school entrance exam rather than seek a job?
	- Pursuing a master's degree has always been my dream. I felt that entering the workforce permaturely would limit my growth. So I chose to take the exam. Through this journey, I aim to connect with diverse individuals, expand my horizons, and achieve greater accomplishments.

- 最喜欢的专业课?
	- Among the various courses in computer science, my favorite is operating system. This academic inclination stems from the course's unique capacity to unravel the fundamental mechanisms governing computational systems, particularly in areas like concurrent process management and memory allocation architectures. This systematic understanding has directly enhanced my software engineering competencies. 

- 最喜欢的编程语言是什么?
	- Within the programming language paradigm, Rust - a memory-safe systems programming language with zero-cost abstractions - has become my most programming language. Its unique ownership model and compile-time memory management not only eliminate data races in concurrent systems but also enable hardware-level performance optimization. While Rust's syntax presents an initially daunting learning curve with is affine type annoations and explicit lifetime parameters, this very rigor cultivates a profoundly systematic approach to problem-solving. So I believe rust deserved my faviorite.

- 最喜欢的城市
	- Nestled in the heart of Sichuan Province, Chengdu is a captivating blend of ancient charm and modern vibrancy. Known as the "Land of Abundance" for its fertile plains and rich resources, this city has enchanted visitors for centuries with its unique culture, spicy cuisine, and leisurely pace of life. With its warm-hearted locals, dynamic arts scene, and perfect balance of tradition and innovation, Chengdu isn't just a city-it's an experience that lingers long after you've left.

- 为什么对计算机感兴趣
	- My interest in computer lies in three reasons. Firstly, I can build various of programs by myself, I can give full play to my creative. Second, through open community, I can help different individuals, which will make me satisfied. Finally,
