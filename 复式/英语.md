## 自我介绍

Good morning distinguished professors, it is my great honor to be here to attend this interview. My name is Wang Yigang. I come from Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan, a beautiful tourist city. I am going to graduate from SWPU, majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

我大一主要学习算法和数据结构，并和同学组建了队伍参加了 ICPC 和 C C P C 比赛，虽然并未在区域赛取得奖项，但我们的队伍还是在

- 为什么考电科
	- I believe that the best university may not necessarily be the most prestigious or renowned, but rather the one that aligns with my academic goals. The reasons why I have chosen UESTC lies in its geographical locations, academic environment and disciplinary strengths. First, UESTC is strategically located in Chengdu, a national central city recognized for its technology innovation ecosystem. Second, UESTC boasts a strong research-oriented academic environment, particularly in artificial intelligence. Finally, UESTC is nationally reowned for its computer science, which directly corrsponds to my intended field of study. Through comprehensive analysis of institutional advantages and personal aspirations, I am convinced that UESTC represents the optimal platform for me to achieve my academic and professional objectives.
	- Boast 值得突出的自豪优势

- 为什么选择考研而不是就业？
	- Pursuing a master's degree has always been my dream. I felt that entering the workforce permaturely would limit my growth. So I chose to take the exam. Through this journey, I aim to connect with diverse individuals, expand my horizons, and achieve greater accomplishments.

- 最喜欢的专业课?
	- Among the various courses in computer science, my favorite is operating system. This academic inclination stems from the course's unique capacity to unravel the fundamental mechanisms governing computational systems, particularly in areas like concurrent process management and memory allocation architectures. This systematic understanding has directly enhanced my software engineering competencies. 

- 最喜欢的编程语言是什么? & 它的优势是什么
	- Within the programming language paradigm, Rust - a memory-safe systems programming language with zero-cost abstractions - has become my most programming language. Its unique ownership model and compile-time memory management not only eliminate data races in concurrent systems but also enable hardware-level performance optimization. While Rust's syntax presents an initially daunting learning curve with is affine type annoations and explicit lifetime parameters, this very rigor cultivates a profoundly systematic approach to problem-solving. So I believe rust deserved my faviorite.

- 最喜欢的城市 & 家乡 & 对成都的印象
	- Nestled in the heart of Sichuan Province, Chengdu is a captivating blend of ancient charm and modern vibrancy. Known as the "Land of Abundance" for its fertile plains and rich resources, this city has enchanted visitors for centuries with its unique culture, spicy cuisine, and leisurely pace of life. With its warm-hearted locals, dynamic arts scene, and perfect balance of tradition and innovation, Chengdu isn't just a city-it's an experience that lingers long after you've left.

- 为什么对计算机感兴趣 & 为什么选择这专业
	- What drives me to computer science is threefold. Firstly, building programs from scratch allows me to turn ideas into functional tools. Second, contributing to open-source projects showed me how code can empower others. Finally, a master mentor sparked my determination to pursue this field.
