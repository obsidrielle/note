## 自我介绍

Good morning distinguished professors, it is my great honor to be here to attend this interview. My name is Wang Yigang. I come from Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan, a beautiful tourist city. I am going to graduate from SWPU, majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

My primary hobby is coding, which I approach as both a creative outlet and a problem-solving challenge. I enjoy building projects ranging from automation scripts to full-stack applications, constantly experimenting with languages like C, Python, and Rust. What excites me most is the process of breaking down complex problems into logical steps and watching abstract ideas materialize through code. I actively participate in open-source communities to collaborate with other developers, which has significantly sharpened my skills in version control and agile workflows.

During my freshman year, I dedicated myself to mastering algorithms and data structures through systematic study and practical application. This foundation led me to compete in prestigious programming contests like ICPC and CCPC, where my team secured multiple awards. Complementing my algorithmic training, I engineered a go-based KV storage engine, implementing a bitcask architecture. Concurrently, I contributed to rCoreOS, which is an educational operating system. These projects crystallized my methodology: applying competition-honed algorithm skills to solve systems challenges.

My projects and algorithm competition experience exposed fundamental OS challenges. I realized the critical need to bridge application demands with OS-level optimizations. I aim to pursue PhD research in operati ng systems, focusing on hardware-software co-design. If admitted to UESTC, I would build theoretical foundations in distributed systems and formal verification, while collaborating on microkernel projects to publish actionable insights. My ultimate goal is to develop provably efficient resource management models that reconcile algorithmic elegance with real-world hardware constraints. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would be honored to contribute my passion for systems research to this esteemed program.
