The Steel King, Andrew Carnegie, reportedly secured business deals by naming companies after at least one competitor and a would-be buyer, and maintained employee morale by calling his factory workers by their first name.

据说，钢铁大王，Andrew Carnegie，通过使用至少一个竞争者和一个潜在的买家的名字命名公司来确保达成商业交易，他还直呼工人的名字，从而提振员工的士气。 

Would-be -> 潜在的
Morale -> 士气
Business deals -> 商业交易
Reportedly -> 据说，据传闻


"If you don't do this," Dale Carnegie warned his readers, "you are headed for trouble." By Carnegie's measure, plenty of people are in serious jeopardy. It's not that they don't remember what their friends and acquaintances are called; rather, saying names makes them feel anxious, nauseated, or simply awkward.

Dale Carnegie 曾经严肃警告读者：“如若不行，必引祸端。”按照他的标准，无数人正处于巨大的危机之中。问题不在于他们记不住亲朋好友的称呼，而是直呼其名的行为本身就会引发焦虑，反胃，乃至于手足无措的窘迫。

Measure -> 标准
Jeopardy -> 危险边缘
Nauseated -> 恶心

In 2023, a group of psychologists dubbed this phenomenon alexinomia. People who feel it most severely might avoid addressing anyone by their name under any circumstance.

2023 年，心理学研究者正式定名这种现象为“称呼恐惧症（alexinomia）”。受此困扰最甚者，无论什么场合都会极力避免叫别人的名字。

Dubbed -> 命名定名
Address -> 称呼

For others, alexinomia is strongest around those they are closest to. Some people can't bring themselves to say the name of their wife or boyfriend or best friend-it can feel too vulnerable, too formal, or too plain awkward.

对其他患者而言，称呼恐惧症在至亲之人面前最为显著。部分患者无法克服心理阻碍来称呼配偶，伴侣或挚友的姓名——总觉得这样会暴露软肋，显得生分，或者尴尬到脚趾抠地。

They are closest to -> 在物理上接近，引申为关系地亲疏
Plain -> 在这里表示强调，即“完全地”

The social function of names in Western society is, in many ways, an outlier. In many cultures, saying someone else's given name is disrespectful, especially if they have higher status than you. Even your siblings, parents, and spouse might never utter your name to you. Opting for relationship terms (auntie) or unrelated nicknames (little cabbage) is the default.

在大多数文化里，直接叫别人的名字是不礼貌的，特别是对方地方比你高时。就连兄弟姐妹，父母夫妻之间，平时也基本不会叫对方的全名，而是用称呼亲戚的称谓（比如姑姑）或者起个可爱的外号（比如小白菜）来代替。不过西方世界是个例外，他们经常直接喊名字。

Meanwhile, American salespeople are trained to say customers' names over and over again. It's also a common tactic for building rapport in business pitches, during telemarketing calls, and on first dates.

Names are a special feature of conversation in part because they're almost always optional. When an element of a conversation isn't grammatically necessary, its use is likely socially meaningful, Steven Clayman, a sociology professor at UCLA, told me.

Clayman has studied broadcast-news journalists' use of names in interviews, and found that saying someone's name could signal-without saying so directly-that you're speaking from the heart.

"It may be that folks with alexinomia have this gut intuition, which is correct, that to use a name is to take a stand, to do something-and maybe something you didn't intend," Clayman said. Another person could misinterpret you saying their name as a sign of closeness or hostility.

Alexinomia is a mostly harmless quirk of the human experience. Still, if you avoid saying the names of those closest to you, it can skew their perception of how you feel about them. One of Ditye's study participants shared that her husband was upset by her inability to say his name. It made him feel unloved.

As Dale Carnegie wrote, "a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language." Pushing through the discomfort and simply saying their name every now and then can remind your loved ones that you care.
