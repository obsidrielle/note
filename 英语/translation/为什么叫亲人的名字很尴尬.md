The Steel King, Andrew Carnegie, reportedly secured business deals by naming companies after at least one competitor and a would-be buyer, and maintained employee morale by calling his factory workers by their first name.

"If you don't do this," Dale Carnegie warned his readers, "you are headed for trouble." By Carnegie's measure, plenty of people are in serious jeopardy. It's not that they don't remember what their friends and acquaintances are called; rather, saying names makes them feel anxious, nauseated, or simply awkward.

Dale Carnegie 曾经严肃警告读者：“如若不行，必引祸端。”按照他的标准，无数人正处于巨大的危机之中。问题不在于他们记不住亲朋好友的称呼，而是直呼其名的行为本身就会引发焦虑，反胃，乃至于手足无措的窘迫。

Measure -> 标准
Jeopardy -> 危险边缘
Nauseated -> 恶心

In 2023, a group of psychologists dubbed this phenomenon alexinomia. People who feel it most severely might avoid addressing anyone by their name under any circumstance.

For others, alexinomia is strongest around those they are closest to. Some people can't bring themselves to say the name of their wife or boyfriend or best friend-it can feel too vulnerable, too formal, or too plain awkward.

The social function of names in Western society is, in many ways, an outlier. In many cultures, saying someone else's given name is disrespectful, especially if they have higher status than you. Even your siblings, parents, and spouse might never utter your name to you. Opting for relationship terms (auntie) or unrelated nicknames (little cabbage) is the default.

Meanwhile, American salespeople are trained to say customers' names over and over again. It's also a common tactic for building rapport in business pitches, during telemarketing calls, and on first dates.

Names are a special feature of conversation in part because they're almost always optional. When an element of a conversation isn't grammatically necessary, its use is likely socially meaningful, Steven Clayman, a sociology professor at UCLA, told me.

Clayman has studied broadcast-news journalists' use of names in interviews, and found that saying someone's name could signal-without saying so directly-that you're speaking from the heart.

"It may be that folks with alexinomia have this gut intuition, which is correct, that to use a name is to take a stand, to do something-and maybe something you didn't intend," Clayman said. Another person could misinterpret you saying their name as a sign of closeness or hostility.

Alexinomia is a mostly harmless quirk of the human experience. Still, if you avoid saying the names of those closest to you, it can skew their perception of how you feel about them. One of Ditye's study participants shared that her husband was upset by her inability to say his name. It made him feel unloved.

As Dale Carnegie wrote, "a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language." Pushing through the discomfort and simply saying their name every now and then can remind your loved ones that you care.
